I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive

In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darlin', what did you expect?

I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
